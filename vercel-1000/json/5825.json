  "Warning": "Our lab's analytical process can never determine the salt anion. The sender noted the fumarate salt of the chemical, but this is not something we can confirm or reject. Submitter indicated potential synthesis impurities, but none were detected. Not all synthesis impurities might be detected using GC/MS.",
