  "Warning": "Submitter: I was given a pill a few months ago, which resulted in the most horrific experience in my life and nearly dying. It was the first and last psychoactive pill I've taken. The person who gave it to me does not know what was in it either. He simply says it is an 'E Pill'. The effects of the pill were overloading and locking up of my nerves, extreme heart rate, hypertension, hypothermia, and psychological effect.\n\nBased on the effects I believe it is a combination of MDMA, PCP, and amphetamines, but that's just speculation.",
