  "Warning": "DDL was unable to positively identify all three substances they detected in this unusual sample that had been sold as LSD in Wisconsin. Andrew, an EcstasyData contributor, identified the primary substance as 2C-C-NBOMe.  The other two chemicals were somewhat less clear. The 2C-I-NBOMe could also be 2C-C-NBOMe ME. \n\nThe third chemical appears to be an antioxidant: \n2,2'-Methylenebis(6-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol) \n\nThe antioxidant is unlikely to be psychoactive and might have been intentionally added to protect the chemical from oxidation. Or it could just be a random contaminant.",
