  "Warning": "Regarding Metamizole / 4-Methylaminoantipyrine: Our current GC/MS protocol cannot distinguish between metamizole and 4-methylaminoantipyrine. 4-Methylaminoantipyrine is a metabolite of metamizole. Their mass spectra are indistinguishable because metamizole undergoes thermal decomposition to 4-methylaminoantipyrine and aminopyrine during GC-MS analysis. The chemical identified in this sample could be either Metamizole or 4-Methylaminoantipyrine, or a combination of the two.",
