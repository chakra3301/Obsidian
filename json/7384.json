  "Lab Comments": "Regarding Metamizole / 4-Methylaminoantipyrine:\nOur current GC/MS protocol can not distinguish between metamizole and 4-methylaminoantipyrine. 4-Methylaminoantipyrine is a metabolite of metamizole. Their mass spectra are indistinguishable because metamizole undergoes thermal decomposition to 4-methylaminoantipyrine and aminopyrine during GC-MS analysis. The chemical identified in this sample could be either Metamizole or 4-Methylaminoantipyrine, or a combination of the two.\n\nOriginally identified as 4-methylaminoantipyrine by library match.",
  "Warning": "Jul 8, 2021: Identification of 4-Methylaminoantipyrine changed to Metamizole OR 4-Methylaminoantipyrine.",
