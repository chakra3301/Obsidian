  "Lab Comments": "Methyl-2-phenylacetate by library match [subsequently confirmed by comparing to reference standard]. \n\nPhenylactone (P2P) may or may not be present.  Methyl-2-phenylacetate produces a secondary GC/MS peak of P2P. The ratio detected of P2P to Methyl-2-phenylacetate is similar to a certified standard analysis.",
  "Warning": "Sep 3 2020: The reference standard was received and sample was retested; Methyl-2-phenylacetate confirmed. \n\nAug 27 2020: A reference standard is available for Methyl-2-phenylacetate. To confirm its presence, this sample will be re-analyzed once a reference standard has been ordered and the lab receives it.",
