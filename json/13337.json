  "Lab Comments": "The Fluoromethcathinone isomer is not differentiated.",
  "Warning": "This sample contains *-Fluoromethcathinone, a chemical that has multiple ring-positional isomers. That means that the hexagonal benzene ring that makes up part of the chemical can have 'arms' that form the rest of the chemical attached at various locations around the ring. Some drugs, such as this one, have multiple possible places along the ring that these parts can attach, and have nearly-identical or identical retention times in the Gas Chromatograph (GC) and identical mass spectra (MS). This sample contains *-Fluoromethcathinone, but we can't be certain which position on the ring the rest of the molecule is attached.\n\nThe  N-acetyl-4-fluoromethcathinone is probably a precursor or synthesis byproduct of the manufacture of 4-FMC.",
