  "Warning": "Aug 23 2023: The most abundant unidentified substance has been identified as N-Pyrrolidino Protonitazene and confirmed by comparison to a reference standard. (thank you, E.)  \n\nSubstance #2 is very likely Dilauryl thiodipropionate (not psychoactive). The other three unidentified substances appear to be synthesis byproducts or precursors of the N-Pyrrolidino Protonitazene.\n\nAug 2 2023: This sample contains five unidentified substances. The best library match for the most abundant one (Unidentified-4) is Etonitazepyne (N-Pyrrolidine Etonitazene), however, retention time does not match the reference standard for Etonitazepyne.\n \nIt's possible that Unidentified-4 is the main nitazene compound and #1, #2, #3, and #4 are degradations or impurities? Unidentified-2 could be Dilaurylthiodipropionate.",
