  "Warning": "[Updated] Originally, one of our crew marked this as 'threo-4-Fluoromethylphenidate', which is correct since it refers to the same compound, but is not our standard name for this chemical. Sorry for any confusion.  \n\nThere are multiple stereoisomers / chiral versions of this drug. Our lab standard is based on Cayman's (+/-)-threo-4-Fluoromethylphenidate (hydrochloride) and one of our team entered the threo- name as if it were distinct from our previous identifications of 'any stereoisomer of' 4-fluoromethylphenidate.",
