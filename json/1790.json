  "Warning": "The Tucson Police Department Crime Laboratory (Arizona) recently received several different types of Ecstasy mimic tablets: 5 blue dragonfly tablets (see Photo 1), 2 orange monkey face tablets (see Photo 2), 91 blue Transformers Decepticon shaped tablets (see Photo 3), 232 red, round Buddha tablets (not pictured), and 15 red, round tablets, without an imprint/design of any sort (also not pictured). The tablets were seized by the Tucson Police Department and were submitted as suspected Ecstasy. Analysis of each tablet type by GC/MS identified, not MDMA, but a mixture of approximately 4:1 N-benzylpiperazine (BZP) to caffeine (not quantitated, but a high loading based on the TIC.) There were four separate submissions to date. [Editor's Note: BZP is a controlled substance in the U.S. (Schedule I). It is a stimulant. The 'Decepticon' tablets first appeared in the January issue; see: Microgram Bulletin 2009;42(1)3.]",
