  "Warning": "2023 Aug 14: After extensive research, we've been unable to definitively identify these three unidentified substances. The closest we've come is that two seem like they might be some pthalates except there's no mz 149. We have a theoretical explanation for how that could be possible, but nothing more than speculation. For the third unidentified, there are some similarities to some known plasticizers.  \n\nCurrently, we think none of these three unidentifieds are psychoactive drugs, but we can't be sure.",
