  "Warning": "Sample sent in from Florida, USA. Submitter indicates they expect sample to be 'possible methaqualone analogue, or some form of research chemical. Also, believed to be cut with additional unknown ingredients.'\n\nReminder: EcstasyData is not allowed to determine quantitative amounts of drugs in samples.\n\nSubmitter indicates they expect sample to be 'possible methaqualone [...] believed to be cut with additional unknown ingredients'. The total mass of this sample including any diluents, if present, was ~200 mg. While methaqualone and diphenhydramine were the only active chemicals (indicated by the ratios '4' and '1') that were detected, it is impossible to extrapolate what mass of methaqualone is present within the 200 mg.",
