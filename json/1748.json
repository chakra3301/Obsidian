  "Warning": "The DEA Southwest Laboratory (Vista, California) recently received two dirty tablets with identical but worn, indiscernible logos, suspected Ecstasy (see Photo 5, next page). The exhibits were seized in San Diego by FBI personnel, consequential to a search warrant for methamphetamine and cocaine base (no further details). Both tablets were white, round (approximately 7.5 millimeters in diameter), unscored, biconvex, and had an average weight of 189.8 milligrams. Analysis by GC and GC/MS, however, indicated not MDMA but rather cocaine (salt form not determined; not quantitated but a moderate loading based on the TIC). Ecstasy-type tablets containing cocaine are rarely submitted to the Southwest Laboratory. [Editor's Note: Unlike the tablets analyzed by the Los Angeles Police Department's Scientific Investigation Division Narcotics Analysis Unit (preceding Intelligence Alert), these tablets did not contain either isopropylbenzylamine or caffeine.]",
