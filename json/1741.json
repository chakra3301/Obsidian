  "Warning": "The DEA Mid-Atlantic Laboratory (Largo, Maryland) recently received 705 yellow tablets with a Superman logo, suspected MDMA. The exhibits were seized at a mail distribution facility in Norfolk, Virginia by the Norfolk Police. Analysis of the tablets (total net mass 198.1 grams) by GC/MS, TLC, and GC confirmed MDMA (10.9 milligrams/tablet), adulterated with methamphetamine (6.1 milligrams/tablet), N-benzylpiperazine (BZP), 1-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl)-piperazine (TFMPP), dibenzylpiperazine, caffeine, and procaine. The three piperazines were not quantitated; however, based on the TIC and GC, the BZP and TFMPP were both higher in concentration than the MDMA and methamphetamine. The tablets also contained MDP2P and piperonal (both indicative of the MDMA synthesis route). The Mid-Atlantic Laboratory has seen a wide variety of Ecstasy combination tablets containing both MDMA and methamphetamine, and a few Ecstasy-mimic tablets containing BZP and TFMPP mixtures, but this is believed to be the first such submission containing all four of these drugs.",
