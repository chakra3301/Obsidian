  "Warning": "Aug 11 2022: The lab ran Morris reagent again with a sufficient amount of material, this time the reaction was the same as the first time.\n\nAugust 9 2022 - Regarding 'No Reaction' for the Morris Reagent with this sample: Morris is known for not reacting to cocaine when too little material is checked with this reagent. We are asking the lab to try the Morris reagent again with a larger sub-sample. (Thanks for pointing out this issue, J.!)",
