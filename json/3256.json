  "Warning": "Submitter: Please do the most scientific analysis possible. \n\nErowid Note: The lab does the same analysis on every sample. The samples are first tested with the field reagents, then dissolved in a solvent and injected into the GC/MS machine. Different solvents can be used depending on the specific sample, but once the sample dissolves in the solvent, from there it's just the normal analysis.\n\nOnly MDMA was found in this sample, though basic salts and sugars are not detected by the GC/MS analysis the lab does. Please read more of the documentation on the site if you want to understand the testing process better.",
