  "Warning": "Jul 7, 2019: After running the reference standard for  Androsta-3,5-diene-7,17-dione and re-analyzing this sample, the lab confirmed that it contains  Androsta-3,5-diene-7,17-dione. The Unidentified has not yet been identified.\n\nThis sample will be re-analyzed to confirm library match once the lab receives the reference standard for Androst-3,5-diene-7,17-dione that is being ordered. Please check back in 14-21 days. (The identification of the Androst-3,5-diene-7,17-dione portion was not ambiguous; this re-testing is normal procedure for chemicals identified by library match for which the lab doesn't have a reference standard on site.)",
