  "Warning": "SaferParty and raveitsafe issued an information alert for this sample because of the dose and because it could be mistaken for a normal gummy bear.\n\nTheir alert:\n\nA very intense psychedelic experience, which can be disturbing and scary, can be caused even at this dose. On average, the LSD blotter analyzed by SaferParty/raveitsafe in 2016 contained 58.8 μg LSD. Due to the trivialized form (as a gummy bear) of this sample, there is a risk of inadvertent ingestion of LSD by inexperienced persons (especially children).",
