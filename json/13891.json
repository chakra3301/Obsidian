  "Lab Comments": "Samples #13889, #13891, #13895, and a sample from July 2022 (#13614) contain the same unidentified substance. It appears to be some sort of impurity or analog of fentanyl.  [now Tentatively Identified, see below]",
  "Warning": "Feb 14 2024: The tentative identification of the unspecified fentanyl synthesis byproduct in this sample is 1-(4-(phenethyl(phenyl)amino)piperidin-1-yl)propan-1-one. (Thank you, Y.)\n\nSep 21 2022: The previously unidentified substance in this sample is likely an inactive fentanyl synthesis byproduct.",
