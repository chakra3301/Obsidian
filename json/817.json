  "Warning": "Information was submitted with this tablet saying that a Marquis test had turned \"bright yellow fairly quickly\", and Mecke test had turned \"slow to pale yellow\".  The lab found different results with both the Marquis and Mecke tests showing no reaction.  We don't have a good explanation for this at this time.  One possible explanation is that the outside of the tablet may have been contaminated with another substance.",
