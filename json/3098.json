  "Warning": "Information about this tablet was sent out as one of SaferParty's cautions because it could be consumed as ecstasy and individuals may redose too early if the effects aren't what they expect. They write [translated from Deutsch/German]:\n\n2C-B is a hallucinogenic Mescaline derivative, which is psychoactive in small amounts. Since the full effect do not begin until after 60 minutes, there is a danger that users might redose and thus take a high dose 2C-B. A few milligrams of 2C-B can alter the effects. Starting around 10mg, 2C-B has a hallucinogenic effect which could be perceived by inexperienced users as unpleasant and can lead to anxiety and potentially a personal crisis.",
