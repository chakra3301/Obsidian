  "Warning": "Submitter: Mecke reagent tested purple right away. Marquis reagent however only tested a tinge of purple with more of an orange/yellow hue. One capsule provided mile euphoria but effects appear to begin a bit later than typical MDMA (1:15 to 1:30 after ingestion). Dilated pupils associated with this. Duration of effects was 3-4 hours. Two capsules taken at once resulted in what appeared to be signs of possible MDMA toxicity, including mild diaphoresis, temporary urinary retention, and mild mental 'haziness' for the next day-week.",
