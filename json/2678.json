  "Warning": "Submiter writes: MXE in particular has very strange and inconsistent reactions with Mecke, in my experience. The reaction is very slow -- it needs to be observed for at least 10 minutes, if not 30 -- and is generally yellow with brown coronas usually developing slowly and then dissipating over time. Sometimes there are green spots that appear and then eventually disappear, too. I'm actually shocked that this sample did not have some cut, given those inconsistent green spots.",
