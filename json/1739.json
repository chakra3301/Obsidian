  "Warning": "The Pennsylvania State Police Crime Laboratory in Lima, Pennsylvania, recently received a poly-drug submission including 42 round green tablets marked with the Batman logo on one face and half-scored on the reverse face, suspected MDMA. Analysis of the green tablets (total net mass 14.9 grams) by GC/MS, however, indicated not MDMA but rather a 1 : 1 mixture of caffeine and 3,4-methylenedioxymethylnitrostyrene (an intermediate in the synthesis of MDA or 3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl-2-propanone). When tested with the Marquis reagent, the samples from the green tablets turned black, but the color did not spread into the liquid.",
