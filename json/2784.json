Please do not send that much material to the lab! \n\nThe lab was unable to identify the substance submitted, but the Mass Spectrum is consistent with the name of the substance submitted: 'AB-PINACA', a cannabinoid receptor agonist. That means it *might* have effects similar to cannabis, but there are very reports of human use and it should be considered a research chemical.",
