  "Warning": "The lab spent time today on the question of the different salts of fentanyl variants. The lab is not able to tell the difference between fentanyl citrate versus fentanyl HCl. \n\nThey can conclusively differentiate between fentanyl and acetyl fentanyl, which are considered to be different drugs. The salt anions are not easy to identify with normal techniques and there's no practical method that we know of to do the differentiation.\n\nearth",
