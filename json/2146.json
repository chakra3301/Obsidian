  "Warning": "A brown liquid from a dropper bottle was analyzed via GC/MS and found to contain an active level of LSD along with inactive levels (relative to the LSD) of MDMA and Ketamine. The sample also contained the MDMA synthesis byproduct Methylenedioxypropanol, and an antioxidant. \n\nWe don't really know what's going on with this sample, but either this bottle was used to store MDMA, then later ketamine, and then finally to hold acid, all without washing the bottle out in between substances; or MDMA and ketamine were added to an LSD preparation at intentionally homeopathic levels -- but that seems less likely.\n\nIt's curious, either way.",
