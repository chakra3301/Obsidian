  "Lab Comments": "The unidentified substance in this analysis appears to be 'malonamide of pentobarbital', which is either a breakdown product of pentobarbital present in the submitted sample or it could be a byproduct produced during the testing method (GC/MS) itself. Our lab re-ran the sample and re-ran their standard for pentobarbital and their standard did not produce a mass spectrum exactly matching this 'malonamide of pentobarbital'.",
