  "Warning": "There is a discrepancy in the number of capsules ingested as described in the article Abstract ('one') vs. the article Discussion ('two'). \n\nIn the discussion, the authors remark: 'Our patient died after ingesting two capsules despite expeditious treatment. Based on analytic evidence from a single capsule, we suspect she ingested 844 mg of methylone plus 106 mg of butylone. The dose the patient ingested was substantially over what has been reported as a 'normal' dose. However, we cannot confirm this dose since any illicitly marketed drug has substantial variability in purity and concentration.'",
