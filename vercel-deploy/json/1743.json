  "Warning": "The DEA Northeast Laboratory (New York, New York) recently received 12 round, mottled blue tablets with a 'Michael Jordan' logo, suspected Ecstasy. The exhibits were acquired by personnel from the DEA New England Field Division at a locale in Massachusetts (exact location and details sensitive). Analysis of the tablets (total net mass 3.2 grams) by GC/MS, LCMS, GC/FID, and FTIR/ATR, however, indicated not MDMA but rather 1-benzylpiperazine (BZP; 78.7 milligrams per tablet), ketamine, 1-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl)piperazine (TFMPP), 1,4-dibenzylpiperazine, and caffeine (only the BZP was quantitated). This is the fifth time within the past year that the Northeast Laboratory has seen BZP. Tablets with the 'Michael Jordan' logo have also been previously submitted to the laboratory, but none of the previous tablets with this logo contained BZP.",
