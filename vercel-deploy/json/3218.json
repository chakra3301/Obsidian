  "Warning": "Very curiously, the same submitter sent two samples that both tested via GC/MS as the same chemical (ethylone), yet they seemed to have very different reactions to the field tests. It is possible the first sample was much weaker/diluted, but we do not have a clear explanation for why these two samples would have such different reagent color reactions.",
