  "Lab Comments": "Initially analyzed twice, with absolutely no LSD detected. Third analysis consumed rest of sample and found a small LSD peak and verified LSD Mass Spectrum.",
  "Warning": "Aug 22 2020: After receiving additional information, we're going to take another look at the two microdot LSD samples.  'No drugs detected' means nothing showed up at all on the GC. This could be a 'cold spot' problem from non-homogenous distribution of the drug in the solid tablet. Or it could be one of several other issues. Please check back in a week.",
