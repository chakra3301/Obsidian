  "Warning": "Reminder that the main reason to use DrugsData to test a plant sample is if it is suspected of being adulterated. Our program is targeted at analyzing and detecting street drugs.\n\nWithout prior agreement, the lab we work with is limited to analyzing samples that come in a dry powder, blotter, or tablet form (no sticky, viscous, moist, or liquid samples). This program is not the best option for getting a full-alkaloid profile of a plant product, they are complex in their chemistry and can produce difficult-to-interpret results in GC/MS.",
