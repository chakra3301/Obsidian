  "Warning": "Comment from submitter: '\nEveryone that has taken them said they enjoyed them but that it took anywhere from 3 to 6 to get a good 'roll.' My reagent tests with Marquis and Mecke had no reaction, so I was waiting to see these results to take them myself. Honestly, I won't consume them now that I know what's in them. But user reports were 'felt like my first time rolling,' to 'I enjoyed them but it didn't have that 'magic' like MDMA has.' But I knew it wasn't methylone from the reagent tests, let alone MDMA or MDxx of some sort. :-/ '",
