  "Lab Comments": "Best match for this methylmethcathinone is 3-MMC, but could be 2-MMC. The lab said it is not currently able to be more certain about differentiating the ring substituted variations of this substance.",
  "Warning": "Dec 23: 2019: Sample was re-analyzed after a certified reference standard for Isopentedrone was received at the lab. The original identification of Isopentedrone in this sample was wrong and Isopentedrone is now ruled out. The identification has been re-categorized from Isopentedrone to Unidentified. This Unidentified chemical has a very similar MS but the retention time for the standard is 5.4 minutes and the Unidentified compound retention time is 8.1 minutes. \n\nDec 19, 2019: Slight clarification of language describing the identification.\n\nDec 18, 2019: A reference standard is available for Isopentedrone. This sample will be re-analyzed once a reference standard has been ordered and the lab receives it. (The identification of Isopentedrone was not ambiguous; this re-testing is normal procedure for chemicals identified by library match for which the lab doesn't have a reference standard on site.)",
