  "Warning": "The DEA South Central Laboratory (Dallas, Texas) recently received 30 pink, round tablets imprinted with an 'Alien' face, suspected Ecstasy. The exhibits were seized in Sherwood, Arkansas by the Sherwood Police (no further details). Analysis of the tablets (total net mass 4.9 grams) by FTIR/ATR and GC/MS, however, indicated not MDMA but rather 4-iodo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine hydrochloride (2C-I; not quantitated but a moderate loading based on the TIC). Currently, 2C-I is not formally scheduled in the Controlled Substance Act, but it is considered to be an analogue of 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine (2C-B). The South Central Laboratory has received 12 submissions of 2C-I over the last four years, and has also previously received Ecstasy and Ecstasy-type tablets with the 'Alien' face logo.",
