  "Warning": "The DEA Northeast Laboratory (New York, New York) recently received 1,000 off-white, yellowish colored tablets with a light 'G' imprint on one side, suspected 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (see Photos 14 and 15). The tablets were seized by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, New Jersey Field Office (no further details). Analysis of the tablets (total net mass 829 grams) by color test, GC/FID, GC/MS, FTIR/ATR, and capillary electrophoresis indicated 20.6 milligrams/tablet of methamphetamine, adulterated with dimethylsulfone, caffeine, and procaine hydrochloride (not quantitated). The laboratory routinely analyzes tablets and powders containing methamphetamine. This was an unusual submission due to the high concentration of dimethylsulfone (not quantitated) compared to that of methamphetamine (2.7 %).",
