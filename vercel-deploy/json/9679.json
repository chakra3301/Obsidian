  "Warning": "Jan 21, 2021: This sample's reagent colors were described differently at time of publication. On consultation with the DrugsData crew we've updated them. It's the crew's opinion that the colors present in the photos are the result of the tablet's coloring, and not a true change of the reagent colors.\n\nOther compounds like alpha-PiHP, 4-chloro-alpha-PVP, 3-fluoro-alpha-PVP or 4-fluoro-alpha-PVP that are closely related to 3-fluoro-4-methyl-alpha-PVP and 4-fluoro-3-methyl-alpha-PVP produce no color change.",
