  "Warning": "The Johnson County Crime Laboratory (Mission, Kansas) recently received 492 tablets of suspected Ecstasy. The tablets were seized by the Johnson County Sheriff's Office pursuant to a traffic stop in Olathe, Kansas. The tablets were of four types: 175 red tablets with an apple logo, (1 was approximately twice as thick as the others), 166 purple tablets with a Superman logo, 75 blue tablets with a dragonfly logo, and 76 orange tablets with a monkey face logo (no photos available). Analysis of the tablets by GC/MS confirmed, not MDMA, but rather BZP. 1,4-Dibenzylpiperazine, TFMPP, and caffeine were also detected, but not confirmed. Although not quantitated, the ratio of BZP to TFMPP was approximately 2:1 based on the TIC. The loading of both BZP and TFMPP was high compared to the other components in the sample. This is the largest submission of tablets containing BZP and TFMPP the laboratory has received.",
