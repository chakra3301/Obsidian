  "Warning": "At our request, DDL tried a couple of techniques on the recent blotter we've gotten to try to use the field reagent tests with the blotter. The results were inconclusive and it's not obvious how well the reagent tests can work with either paper blotter or with doses probably under half a milligram.\n\nUpdate Dec 1 2013: According to our experts, this result is consistent with LSZ, but we haven't been able to positively identify this yet.",
