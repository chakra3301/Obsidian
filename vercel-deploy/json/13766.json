  "Lab Comments": "Tested 3x, entire sample used up in analysis. No LSD present. Did not fluoresce in UV light.",
  "Warning": "Aug 16 2022: The lab has performed several additional tests to investigate why the reagent colors look atypical for a ketamine sample. A current theory is that an inert diluent in the powder that doesn't show up in GC/MS could be causing reagent color reactions. The lab may be able to rinse the capsule for one more analysis. Check back for updates.",
