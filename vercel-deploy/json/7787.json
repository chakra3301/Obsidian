  "Lab Comments": "Sep 29 2020: Ketamine Precursor A -- chemical name 1-[(2-Chlorophenyl)(methylimino)methyl]cyclopentanol -- was initially identified by library match, and has been confirmed with reference standard.",
  "Warning": "Ketamine with detectable trace amounts of two impurities, meaning they're in such low quantities that they aren't ascribed a ratio relative to the ketamine.\n\nRegarding isomers -- The lab's techniques cannot distinguish stereo isomers composition of any substance we analyze. A result saying 'Ketamine : 1' could be 50/50 R-enantiomer & S-enantiomer, 100% R-enantiomer and 0% S-enantiomer, 0% R-enantiomer and 100% S-enantiomer, or any ratio combination thereof.",
