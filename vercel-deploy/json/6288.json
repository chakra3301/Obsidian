  "Warning": "The lab ran this sample a second time in an attempt to differentiate it. While 3-fluoro-a-PVP and 4-fluoro-a-PVP retention times are very, very close, this sample is closer to 4-fluoro-a-PVP. We are unable to be more certain than that with ring substituted substances such as these at this time.",
