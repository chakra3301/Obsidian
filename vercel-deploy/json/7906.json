  "Warning": "If a cotton and especially if a cooker / spoon is reused, the risk of cross-contamination increases. This means that whatever the cooker or cotton came in contact with previously can show up in an analysis. DrugsData doesn't know whether this cotton+cooker were new/clean when they were used the last time before the cotton was mailed in for analysis.\n\nHarm reduction precautions recommend that the cotton *AND* the cooker need to be single-use only!",
