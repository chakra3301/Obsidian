  "Lab Comments": "Antioxidant-2246 identification by spectral match only, not confirmed with lab standard.",
  "Warning": "Feb 20, 2020: After more searching, the lab has tentatively identified the previously unidentified substance as a small amount of a chemical antioxidant that might have been used in the paper or dye, or possibly intentionally added as a stabilizer.  We have not seen this chemical before in our analyses.\n\nFeb 6, 2020: Two things about this sample: 1) The Ehrlich reaction is unusual, and we think it may be because the reagent itself might be oxidized/bad. We ordered a fresh Ehrlich reagent and will be redoing the Ehrlich next week. *This does not impact the GC/MS result, which won't change*. 2) The second substance is very unlikely to be psychoactive and is probably a non-toxic antioxidant (at this very small dose).",
