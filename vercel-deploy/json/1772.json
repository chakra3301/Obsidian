  "Warning": "The Canton-Stark County Crime Laboratory (Canton, Ohio)  received two round tablets, one small and green and the other typically sized and blue, alleged 'Triple Ecstasy' (purportedly an unusually potent form of Ecstasy; no photos). The exhibits were acquired in Alliance, Ohio (east of Canton) by an Alliance Police Department Special Investigative Unit (no further details). The green tablet was approximately 5 millimeters in diameter and 5 millimeters thick, weighed 170 milligrams, and had a 5-point star logo. The blue tablet was approximately 8 millimeters in diameter and 5 millimeters thick, weighed 270 milligrams, and had a deeply cut triangle logo. Analysis of both tablets by color testing (Marquis - negative), FTIR, and GC/MS, however, indicated not MDMA but rather a 3 : 2 mixture of 1-(3-chlorophenyl)piperazine (mCPP) and caffeine (not quantitated but a high loading based on the TIC). This is the first submission of Ecstasy mimic tablets containing mCPP, and also the first submission of a small Ecstasy mimic tablet, to the laboratory.",
