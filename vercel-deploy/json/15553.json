  "Warning": "Feb 22 2023: All three unidentified substances resemble ones previously detected in  DrugsData samples.\n\nUnidentified-1 in this sample resembles Unidentified-1 in sample #12239, tentatively identified as 2-tert-Butyl-4,6-dimethylphenol (CAS# 1879-09-0, syn: Oxymetazoline impurity).\n\nUnidentified-2 in this sample is similar to the spectrum for Unidentified-2 in sample #12239.\n\nUnidentified-3 in this samples resembles the Unidentified-3 in sample #12239, which is similar to the spectrum for 1,4,7,14,17,20-hexaoxacyclohexacosane-8,13,21,26-tetraone (CAS# 314254-68-7, syn: Adipate Diethylene glycol cyclic dimer).\n\n2-tert-Butyl-4,6-dimethylphenol would be considered a synthesis byproduct. If present at anything above tiny amounts, it would likely burn the mouth if tasted or burn at the injection site if injected.\n\n1,4,7,14,17,20-hexaoxacyclohexacosane-8,13,21,26-tetraone doesn't appear to be psychoactive.\n\nWe're not able to confirm these proposed identifications at this time. (thanks to Y. for the identifications)",
