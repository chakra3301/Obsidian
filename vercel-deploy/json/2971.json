  "Warning": "This material was submitted as a substance sold in headshops in the 1970s as opium. The analysis revealed a handful of acids including palmitic acid, myristic acid, and phenylacetic acid, all things found in food supplements. There were a number of unidentified compounds but none of them matched any opium-derived substance. Nothing in this sample matches codeine, morphine, heroin, thebaine, papaverine, noscapine, or other common opioids.",
