  "Warning": "Lab initially reported only lorazepam, although during their first test they found a trace of alprazolam. On their second test, they found no alprazolam. The submitter contacted us saying that they expected alprazolam in the same, so the lab re-homogenized the powder and ran two separate samples from the capsule.\n\nOn both subsequent runs they found a small trace of alprazolam, less than 1/20th of the size of the lorazepam peak in the GC (Gas Chromatograph), which indicates relative amounts. \n\nThe sample was not fully homogenized and the amount of alprazolam in the sample was less than 1/20th of the amount of lorazepam.",
