  "Warning": "Sep 20 2023: An Erowid Expert Network senior chemist comments that this is not DMMA, explaining:\n\n''It could be a 'dimer' of DMAA sharing the nitrogen, but that would give a molecular ion of 213 ... other somewhat similar compounds (diamines with chains of varying lengths and branches) have detectable molecular ions and the molecular ion is the most abundant in the group around that mz.''\n\nAug 1 2023: We're ordering a certified reference standard of Methylhexanamine (CAS# 13803-74-2) and will run this sample against it after the lab receives the standard. Check back for updates.\n\nJul 31 2023: Sample was submitted under the name ''1,3-dimethylamylamine (geranium)''. The names DMAA, Geranamine, and 1,3-Dimethylamylamine are included among the many synonyms for CAS# 105-41-9 (1,3-Dimethylpentylamine).\n\nPubchem also lists a separate CAS# -- 13803-74-2 -- for 1,3-Dimethylpentylamine hydrochloride (synonym: 1,3-Dimethylamylamine).\n\nCayman carries CAS# 13803-74-2 under the name Methylhexanamine and lists Dimethylamylamine, DMAA, and Geranamine among synonyms.",
