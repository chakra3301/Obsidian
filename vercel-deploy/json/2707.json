  "Warning": "Note that ecstasydata is now, as of December 2012, marking Mecke results that are consistent with MDMA as 'Turquoise'. Attached to this result is a photo of DDL's typical Mecke reagent test reactions to MDMA, which is a very dark blue-green that goes to dark enough to look blackish, with blue-green edges.\n\nThe previous EcstasyData/DDL standard was to record this same effect as 'green to purple', however it's clear that is not the best description of the typical response of Mecke reagent to MDMA.",
