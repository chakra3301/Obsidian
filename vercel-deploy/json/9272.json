The submission forms were not fastened to the corresponding samples. \n\nIn this case, because the samples were distinctly different from one another, the risk of mismatching samples and forms is extremely low. However, this highlights the importance of securely and unambiguously coupling a sample with its own submission form when sending in samples to DrugsData.",
