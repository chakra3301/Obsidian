  "Sold as": "AL-LAD",
  "Expected to be": "AL-LAD",
  "Lab Comments": "AL-LAD and DET identified by library match. Unidentified substance closely matches α-Ethyltryptamine (αET). No LSD, 1B-LSD or 1P-LSD detected in this sample.",
  "Warning": "Mar 30, 2021: A certified reference standard became available for AL-LAD and sample was retested -- AL-LAD now confirmed, DET and αET also confirmed.\n\nDec 26, 2019: A certified reference standard for AL-LAD isn't currently available. Reference standards are available for DET and αET, and have been ordered. They are controlled substances in the US, so the process takes longer (2-4 weeks). Sample will be re-analyzed after the lab receives the standards for DET and αET. Check back for updates in mid-January.\n\nDec 23, 2019: We are waiting on a clarification from the lab about this sample's results.",
