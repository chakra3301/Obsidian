  "Lab Comments": "Acetaminophen portion of ratio is at least 50\n\nRegarding Metamizole / 4-Methylaminoantipyrine:\nOur current GC/MS protocol can not distinguish between metamizole and 4-methylaminoantipyrine. 4-Methylaminoantipyrine is a metabolite of metamizole. Their mass spectra are indistinguishable because metamizole undergoes thermal decomposition to 4-methylaminoantipyrine and aminopyrine during GC-MS analysis. The chemical identified in this sample could be either Metamizole or 4-Methylaminoantipyrine, or a combination of the two.",
  "Warning": "There's a very high likelihood that this sample came in contact with other samples prior to being sent to DrugsData, so some components are likely the result of cross contamination.",
