  "Warning": "This sample has what appears to be two very similar chemicals in it. The lab tentatively identified the substances as either 4-AcO-MIPT and 5-MEO-MIPT. The lab was unable to positively identify the two chemicals, but one of our experts determined that they are, in fact, 4-HO-MIPT and 5-Methoxy-MIPT.",
