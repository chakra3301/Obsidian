Summary below in Note.\n\nUnidentified Substance #1: 3 parts\n\nUnidentified Substance #2: 2 parts\n\nUnidentified Substance #3: 15 parts \n\nUnidentified Substance #4: 1 parts\n\nUnidentified Substance #5: 2 parts \n\nUnidentified Substance #6: 7 parts",
  "Warning": "Sep 9 2022: According to one chemist, unidentified substance #1 is similar to 2-Amino-5-Chlorbenzophenone [CAS #719-59-5)], and #2 is similar to N-(2-benzoyl-4-chlorophenyl)acetamide [CAS# 13788-59-5] (thank you, Y.).\n\nJun 17 2022: Sucrose octaacetate matched for Unidentified #6. The DrugsData lab does not normally identify and report sugars. This version of sucrose is a bittering agent used in commercial products to reduce accidental ingestion. This is a special case, please do not ask us to identify simple sugars and salts.\n\nUpdate Jan 29, 2021:  We have re-attempted to identify these and found no matches with updated libraries and hundreds of new reference standards added to our library since the first analysis. We will attempt again in the future.",
