  "Warning": "Submitter: Powder sold as 'sassafras', supposedly an actual extract from the plant in October, 2013. Expect it to be a synthetic MDMA analog.\n\nEcstasyData: Sassafras is a somewhat common street name for MDMA or MDA, although often the 'organic ecstasy' is brown in color to go along with the natural source myth. This sample is clearly synthetic MDMA, not sourced from a plant extract.",
