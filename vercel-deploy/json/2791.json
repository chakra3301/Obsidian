  "Warning": "Submitter contacted Erowid asking for 'vasoconstriction' to be added as an effect for 25I- and 25C-NBOMe. They cited personal experience and Bluelight and Drugsforum threads as evidence. We asked them about personal experience and they described having purchased 25C-NBOMe blotter from an internet vendor, taking 3 tabs and having clear peripheral vasoconstriction.\n\nWe asked how they knew the identity of the drug on the blotter and they offered to send it in to EcstasyData for testing. This is the result. The confirmed 25C-NBOMe blotter at 3 hits, they said, caused clear peripheral vasoconstriction.",
