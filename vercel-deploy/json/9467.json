  "Warning": "Jul 21, 2021: Sample re-analyzed, Phenethyl-4-Fluoro-4-ANPP confirmed.\n\nMarch 10, 2021: Initially, the chemical now identified as Phenethyl-4-Fluoro-4-ANPP was unidentified. As far as we know, this chemical has never before been identified and is 'new in the literature'.  The identification of this substance is based on extremely technical expert analytical chemistry. If you are a senior analytical chemist with expertise in fentanyl synthesis, please contact us to let us know what you think about this identification.\n\nFor everyone else in the world, we believe Phenethyl-4-Fluoro-4-ANPP is best thought of as a synthesis byproduct of fentanyl, not intentionally included by the manufacturer, that has no pharmacological effect, meaning it doesn't have any effect in humans at this dose level.\n\nHowever, this identification must be considered tentative until a reference standard is available for us to compare to. We are now publishing this as our tentative identification, although we do not know of any other lab in the world that has identified this substance.",
