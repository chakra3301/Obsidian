  "Warning": "I was wondering if you had any thoughts on why the ketamine I submitted (ID: 3353) only showed a slight change in color with the mandelin test.  My results using the mandelin reagent were similar, and that is why I submitted the sample for further testing.  However, this particular batch of ketamine seems to be more potent than others that show a better reaction with the mandelin reagent.  Any ideas?",
