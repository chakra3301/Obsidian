  "Warning": "The Ohio Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation in Bowling Green recently received five plastic bags each containing 10 unusually shaped, yellow tablets with a 'Decepticons' logo, suspected Ecstasy (see Photo 4). The tablets were acquired in Findlay, Ohio, by the Metrich Drug Enforcement Unit (details sensitive). Analysis of the tablets (total net mass 14.2 grams) by GC/FID and GC/MS, however, indicated not MDMA but rather a mixture of N-benzylpiperazine (BZP), 1-(3-trifluoromethyl)phenylpiperazine (TFMPP), and caffeine (not quantitated). The laboratory has previously received numerous submissions of tablets containing BZP/TFMPP mixtures, but this was the first submission of Ecstasy or Ecstasy mimic tablets with this shape and logo to the laboratory. [Editor's Notes: According to the analyst, the 'Decepticons' are the antagonists in the fictional 'Transformers' universe. This is the first report of this tablet shape and logo to Microgram.]",
