  "Lab Comments": "Probable match for 25I-NBOMe.\n\nWe've changed this from Unidentified to 25I-NBOMe (2C-I-NBOMe) based on spectra from our experts.\n\nThis is not 100% confirmed, but the spectrum matches another forensic's lab confirmed 25I spectrum very closely. It is also very close to 2C-C-NBOMe, but not quite the same. \n\n We'll be working with the erowid expert network to confirm this identification. If you can help us confirm the identity of this result, please let us know!",
