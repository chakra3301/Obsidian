  "Warning": "A reminder that DrugsData is not allowed to provide quantitative results for samples it analyzes, because our lab is constrained by rules set by the US DEA. If an active chemical is present, as is the case here, inert diluents and cuts (like sugars) are not reported even if they are present. This means 'purity' can't be confirmed, either.",
