We're also not able to analyze for non-psychoactive constituents such as solvents, vitamin E acetate, cellulose, sugars, flavorants, etc.\n\nThe main reason someone would use DrugsData to test a plant extract is if the material is suspected of being adulterated with a research chemical. We accept such samples on a case-by-case basis, by prior approval only.",
