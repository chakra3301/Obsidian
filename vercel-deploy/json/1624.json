  "Warning": "Microgram: The Huntington Beach Police Department Crime Laboratory (California) recently received 12 round blue tablets with a '7' logo, suspected 'Ecstasy' (see Photo 2). The exhibits were seized in Huntington Beach pursuant to a traffic stop for suspected impaired driving (marijuana was also seized). The tablets were 8 millimeters in diameter by 4.5 millimeters thick, and weighed 280 milligrams each. Analysis by color testing, FTIR/ATR, and GC/MS indicated ketamine, procaine, and MDMA in an approximate 53:37:10 ratio (not formally quantitated). This was the first known submission of Ecstasy tablets containing this particular combination to the laboratory.",
