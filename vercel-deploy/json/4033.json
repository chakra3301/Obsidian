  "Warning": "Submitter contacted us to say that they think the lab result might be wrong. The submitter describes the substance as 10-15 times more potent than fentanyl.\n\nIt is possible the submitter mistakenly mixed up samples, but the lab has confirmed that the two samples are apparently identical with no other drugs present. No known fentanyl analog has a mass spectrum fingerprint that is close to this and our lab has an internal analytical standard for fentanyl that matches these samples exactly.",
