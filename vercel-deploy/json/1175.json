  "Lab Comments": "We had doubts about the first results for this tablet, which came back MDE, MDA, MDMA  (5:1:1).  We had the lab retest the material twice.  The first retest of the same dilution resulted in identical results.  The GC/MS then received a major overhaul and had the injector rebuilt and the pills re-scraped, solutions made,  and re-tested and the second re-test resulted in the tablet containing MDMA-Only.",
