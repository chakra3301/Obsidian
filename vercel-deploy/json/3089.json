  "Warning": "Sold as a 2mg alprazolam (Xanax) bar. Instead, sample contained only ketamine. Mandelin reaction was very slight, a small orange cast to the starting yellow reagent color. Normally, mandelin reagent should react much stronger with a dark orange or brownish color. This result suggests that the tablet might contain low amounts of the drug, but this is uncertain.",
