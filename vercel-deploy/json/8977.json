  "Lab Comments": "Analyzed twice.\n\nRegarding Metamizole / 4-Methylaminoantipyrine:\nOur current GC/MS protocol can not distinguish between metamizole and 4-methylaminoantipyrine. 4-Methylaminoantipyrine is a metabolite of metamizole. Their mass spectra are indistinguishable because metamizole undergoes thermal decomposition to 4-methylaminoantipyrine and aminopyrine during GC-MS analysis. The chemical identified in this sample could be either Metamizole or 4-Methylaminoantipyrine, or a combination of the two.",
  "Warning": "Jul 7, 2021: Identification of Metamizole changed to Metamizole OR 4-Methylaminoantipyrine.\n\nPartial tablet accepted for testing by prior approval.",
