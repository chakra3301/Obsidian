  "Warning": "The Pasadena Regional Crime Laboratory (Pasadena, Texas) recently received a submission of 20 round blue tablets, each with a leaping dolphin imprint (not pictured), suspected MDMA. The tablets were seized by Pasadena Police Department personnel in connection with an on-going investigation (no further details). The tablets were medium blue in color with a granular surface that crumbled easily. Each tablet weighed approximately 150 milligrams. Analysis of the tablets by GC/MS, GC-FID, and UV identified 1-(3-chlorophenyl)-piperazine (mCPP) rather than MDMA. This is the laboratory's first encounter with tablets containing mCPP. Recent similar submissions contained BZP and TFMPP, usually with caffeine and/or procaine.",
