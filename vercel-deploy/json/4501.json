  "Sold as": "4-MMC",
  "Expected to be": "High purity racemic n-MMC, hopefully 4-MMC",
  "Lab Comments": "This sample was confirmed by DDL to be 4-MMC after repeated testing and runing lab standards for 2-MMC, 3-MMC, and 4-MMC. This is 4-MMC. 2-MMC and 3-MMC ruled out.",
  "Warning": "Initially, we were able to rule out 3-MMC. We ordered new standards for 2-MMC and 4-MMC from Cayman and were able to positively confirm that the sample is nearly pure 4-MMC.",
