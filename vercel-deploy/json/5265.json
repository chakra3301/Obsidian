Submitted from Santa Barbara, California, USA.\n\nSubmitter notes that their 'reagent tests were all over, I could not get a good determination of what the contaminants were, or if there was even any MDMA. Mecke (I think) turned completely red, which indicates meth, instead of black/blue, while Mandelin (I think) did turn dark.'",
